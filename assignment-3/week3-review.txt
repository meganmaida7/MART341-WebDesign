This week I have already learned SO MUCH! It seems relatively simple, as far as the way things work between Visual Studio Code and Github, but learning about how things work and the reasons behind every character in code is quite amazing! I know I'm in for a lot more learning and growing, so I am ready to prepare my brain, and dive into more!!!
