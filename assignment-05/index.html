            In 1959 New York City, Tom Ripley is approached by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf, who believes that he had attended Princeton with his son Dickie, as he is wearing a borrowed Princeton jacket. Greenleaf pays Ripley to travel to Italy, where Dickie has settled, to persuade him to return to the United States. After a first-class voyage aboard the RMS Queen Mary, Ripley pretends to be Dickie in the Italian ocean liner terminal and befriends American socialite Meredith Logue. </p>

              the seaside village of Mongibello, Ripley befriends Dickie and his expatriate girlfriend Marge Sherwood, claiming to be his former Princeton classmate. He enjoys Dickie's extravagant lifestyle and becomes obsessed with him. Once Dickie's socialite friend Freddie appears, he tires of Ripley and starts spending time with Freddie, who treats him with contempt. When he returns from Rome, when Dickie catches Ripley dressed in his clothes and dancing in front of a mirror, it disturbs him although Dickie had suggested he take a jacket. </p>

             Dickie impregnates a local woman then spurns her, so she drowns herself. Ripley, aware of what has happened, promises a guilt-ridden Dickie to keep it a secret.

            Arguing aboard a small boat, Dickie says that he has grown tired of him and is going to marry Marge, while Ripley insists that Dickie is afraid of their feelings for each other. The argument becomes physical, and Ripley kills Dickie with an oar. Ripley takes Dickie's belongings and scuttles the boat. </p>

            Realizing that people mistake him for Dickie, Ripley assumes his identity. He forges a letter to Marge, convincing her that Dickie has left her and moved to Rome. Ripley creates the illusion that Dickie is still alive by checking into one hotel as Dickie and another as himself, fabricating an exchange of communications between the two. Through forgery, he is able to draw on Dickie's allowance, which allows him to live lavishly. </p>

            In Rome, Ripley runs into Meredith, who still knows him as Dickie, and accepts an invitation from her to attend an opera with her family.

Ripley rushes Meredith out of the opera house on a pretext, then rejects her to prevent himself from being exposed. </p>

            Freddie shows up at Ripley's apartment looking for Dickie, so when the landlady addresses Ripley as Dickie, he realizes the fraud. Ripley bludgeons him to death and disposes of his body. When the body is found, police visit the apartment to question "Dickie". To evade the police and Marge, both of whom are looking for Dickie, Ripley forges Dickie's suicide note, claiming responsibility for Freddie's death. Under his real name, Ripley travels to Venice, where he again encounters Peter. </p>

            Dickie's father arrives in Italy with private detective Alvin MacCarron, and meets with the police. Ripley almost kills Marge after she discovers he has Dickie's rings, but they are interrupted by Peter. Mr. Greenleaf dismisses Marge's suspicions and MacCarron tells Ripley that the police are convinced that Dickie, who had a history of violence, murdered Freddie before killing himself. MacCarron tells Ripley that Greenleaf intends to bequeath a portion of Dickie's trust fund to him to reward his loyalty to Dickie and to ensure his silence. </p>
